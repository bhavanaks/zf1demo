4. Import sql file using phpmyadmin, default mysql access(in WAMP) will be 
	user: root
	nopassword 
5. Update application/configs/application.ini with the mysql access
6. Edit php.ini and turn short_tags On
7. In apache.conf, search for '<Directory C:\wamp\www>', check if AllowOverride All is there.
